# Release rule

Do not consider the legal implementation complete merely because the website contains legal pages.

Production is ready only when:

DOCUMENTATION
=
ACTUAL APP BEHAVIOR
=
DATABASE BEHAVIOR
=
STORAGE BEHAVIOR
=
PROVIDER CONFIGURATION
=
STORE DISCLOSURES

Any material change to one should trigger review of the others.
